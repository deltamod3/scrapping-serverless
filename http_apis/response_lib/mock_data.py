The term flying car is also sometimes used to include hovercars. Many prototypes have been built since the early 20th century, using a variety of flight technologies; some have true VTOL performance. The PAL-V Liberty roadable aircraft targeted 2021 to become the first flying car in full production. Their appearance is often predicted by futurologists, with their failure ever to reach production leading to the catchphrase, Where's my flying car? Flying cars are also a popular theme in fantasy and science fiction stories. The flying car is a discovery. The use of the flying car can be of real help. In the near future, the flying car will be available to everyone. The cost of the flying car should not be prohibitive, so as to be available for many people. The engine of the flying car is already in development. Will the design of the flying car really look like we always imagined it? Some studies believe that the flying car will be available in the year 2050 or so. Will it be true? Can the flying car circulate freely? If we think about the evolution of the car, the flying car could take over the niche market. The technological evolution brings with it improvements, but also collateral damage, always caused by too much use of man. Will the flying car undergo the same treatment? Will all cars be replaced to make room for the flying car? Will air pollution be higher or lower? Will the flying car have real utility? For now we pause to imagine it, but some prototypes of the flying car are already available, obviously not to be bought.",

We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response. In this review, we describe current evidence for the basis of the interactions between pathogens, microbiota, and immune cells on surface barriers and offer explanations for how these interactions may lead to chronic inflammatory disorders.",

The skin is poised to react to infections and injury, such as sunburn, with rapidly acting mechanisms (innate immunity) that precede the development of acquired immunity and serve as an immediate defense system. Some of these mechanisms, including activation of defensins and complement, modify subsequent acquired immunity. An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin. Thus, inflammatory mechanisms may accentuate the effect of UV radiation to amplify direct damaging effects on molecules and cells, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, which cause immunosuppression, cancer, and photoaging. A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo–skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance. Greater knowledge of these processes will also enable the development of improved strategies to repair photodamaged skin.",

These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

At 1.8 square meters for the average adult, skin covers about as much area as a large closet, and accounts for 12-15% of total body weight. The incredible variation in skin — oily, moist, or dry, exposed to light and cold, or dark and warm — even on an individual, creates unique habitats for the thousands of bacterial and fungal species (called commensal microbiota) that live on our skin. The skin immune system may control skin microbes, but our skin commensals can also educate our immune system. How our skin orchestrates this dialogue with microorganisms and physical insult is integral to its function, and to our health.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response. In this review, we describe current evidence for the basis of the interactions between pathogens, microbiota, and immune cells on surface barriers and offer explanations for how these interactions may lead to chronic inflammatory disorders.",

The skin is poised to react to infections and injury, such as sunburn, with rapidly acting mechanisms (innate immunity) that precede the development of acquired immunity and serve as an immediate defense system. Some of these mechanisms, including activation of defensins and complement, modify subsequent acquired immunity. An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin. Thus, inflammatory mechanisms may accentuate the effect of UV radiation to amplify direct damaging effects on molecules and cells, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, which cause immunosuppression, cancer, and photoaging. A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo–skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance. Greater knowledge of these processes will also enable the development of improved strategies to repair photodamaged skin.",

This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells.

Over the years, the skin was proven to have a crucial immunological role, not only being a passive protective barrier but a network of effector cells and molecular mediators that constitute a highly sophisticated compound known as the “skin immune system” (SIS). Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement. However, under stress, the symbiotic relationship changes into a dysbiotic one resulting in skin disorders. Hence, the skin microbiota may have either positive or negative influence on the immune system.

In a genetically susceptible host, imbalances in microbiota-immunity interactions under defined environmental contexts are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of a multitude of immune-mediated disorders. Here, we review features of microbiome-immunity crosstalk and their roles in health and disease, while providing examples of molecular mechanisms orchestrating these interactions in the intestine and extra-intestinal organs.

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Of paramount importance are immunological functions of the skin that protect from harmful exposure coming from external and internal environments. Awareness of skin immunity can provide a better comprehension of inflammation, autoimmunity, cancer, graft-versus-host disease, vaccination, and immunotherapy approaches. This paper will update on what we currently know about immune sentinels contributing to skin immunity.",

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

It is made up of diverse indole alkaloids and is used as traditional medicine for skin application. The actual mechanism behind the virtue of this plant is still unknown. Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Over the years, the skin was proven to have a crucial immunological role, not only being a passive protective barrier but a network of effector cells and molecular mediators that constitute a highly sophisticated compound known as the “skin immune system” (SIS). Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement. However, under stress, the symbiotic relationship changes into a dysbiotic one resulting in skin disorders. Hence, the skin microbiota may have either positive or negative influence on the immune system. This review aims at providing basic background information on the cutaneous immune system from major cellular and molecular players and the impact of its microbiota on the well-coordinated immune responses in host defense.",

The microbiome plays critical roles in the training and development of major components of the host’s innate and adaptive immune system, while the immune system orchestrates the maintenance of key features of host-microbe symbiosis. In a genetically susceptible host, imbalances in microbiota-immunity interactions under defined environmental contexts are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of a multitude of immune-mediated disorders. Here, we review features of microbiome-immunity crosstalk and their roles in health and disease, while providing examples of molecular mechanisms orchestrating these interactions in the intestine and extra-intestinal organs. We highlight aspects of the current knowledge, challenges and limitations in achieving causal understanding of host immune-microbiome interactions, as well as their impact on immune-mediated diseases, and discuss how these insights may translate towards future development of microbiome-targeted therapeutic interventions.",

High-salt diets have been linked to high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even autoimmune disorders. But a new study shows that dietary salt could also have immune-boosting effects. Researchers report that high levels of salt in skin help mice fight off bacteria and that humans may also stockpile salt at infection sites. “The idea that salt storage might have evolved for host defense is very exciting,” says Gwen Randolph, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study. “It’s almost so new that it’s hard to swallow. I think it will take some time for the immunology community to allow this concept to take hold.”",

This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells.

It is made up of diverse indole alkaloids and is used as traditional medicine for skin application. The actual mechanism behind the virtue of this plant is still unknown. Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Over the years, the skin was proven to have a crucial immunological role, not only being a passive protective barrier but a network of effector cells and molecular mediators that constitute a highly sophisticated compound known as the “skin immune system” (SIS). Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement. However, under stress, the symbiotic relationship changes into a dysbiotic one resulting in skin disorders. Hence, the skin microbiota may have either positive or negative influence on the immune system. This review aims at providing basic background information on the cutaneous immune system from major cellular and molecular players and the impact of its microbiota on the well-coordinated immune responses in host defense.",

The microbiome plays critical roles in the training and development of major components of the host’s innate and adaptive immune system, while the immune system orchestrates the maintenance of key features of host-microbe symbiosis. In a genetically susceptible host, imbalances in microbiota-immunity interactions under defined environmental contexts are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of a multitude of immune-mediated disorders. Here, we review features of microbiome-immunity crosstalk and their roles in health and disease, while providing examples of molecular mechanisms orchestrating these interactions in the intestine and extra-intestinal organs. We highlight aspects of the current knowledge, challenges and limitations in achieving causal understanding of host immune-microbiome interactions, as well as their impact on immune-mediated diseases, and discuss how these insights may translate towards future development of microbiome-targeted therapeutic interventions.",

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

It is made up of diverse indole alkaloids and is used as traditional medicine for skin application. The actual mechanism behind the virtue of this plant is still unknown. Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Over the years, the skin was proven to have a crucial immunological role, not only being a passive protective barrier but a network of effector cells and molecular mediators that constitute a highly sophisticated compound known as the “skin immune system” (SIS). Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement. However, under stress, the symbiotic relationship changes into a dysbiotic one resulting in skin disorders. Hence, the skin microbiota may have either positive or negative influence on the immune system. This review aims at providing basic background information on the cutaneous immune system from major cellular and molecular players and the impact of its microbiota on the well-coordinated immune responses in host defense.",

Critically, exposure to commensal microbes or low‐level infection with persisting pathogens can promote tissue homeostasis and enhance resistance to unrelated pathogens.1, 2 However, whether this also extends to protection against the carcinogenic effects of environmental factors such as UV irradiation or toxic agents has remained unclear. In a recent study published in Nature , Strickley and colleagues provide an intriguing example of how constitutive immune activation by a persisting but controlled skin virus, beta papillomavirus, can drive efficient immunity against the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).3 As such, their results provide a fresh view on the clinical association between beta human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and SCC in human patients.",

High-salt diets have been linked to high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even autoimmune disorders. But a new study shows that dietary salt could also have immune-boosting effects. Researchers report that high levels of salt in skin help mice fight off bacteria and that humans may also stockpile salt at infection sites. “The idea that salt storage might have evolved for host defense is very exciting,” says Gwen Randolph, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study. “It’s almost so new that it’s hard to swallow. I think it will take some time for the immunology community to allow this concept to take hold.”",

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

It is made up of diverse indole alkaloids and is used as traditional medicine for skin application. The actual mechanism behind the virtue of this plant is still unknown. Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Over the years, the skin was proven to have a crucial immunological role, not only being a passive protective barrier but a network of effector cells and molecular mediators that constitute a highly sophisticated compound known as the “skin immune system” (SIS). Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement. However, under stress, the symbiotic relationship changes into a dysbiotic one resulting in skin disorders. Hence, the skin microbiota may have either positive or negative influence on the immune system. This review aims at providing basic background information on the cutaneous immune system from major cellular and molecular players and the impact of its microbiota on the well-coordinated immune responses in host defense.",

In a genetically susceptible host, imbalances in microbiota-immunity interactions under defined environmental contexts are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of a multitude of immune-mediated disorders. Here, we review features of microbiome-immunity crosstalk and their roles in health and disease, while providing examples of molecular mechanisms orchestrating these interactions in the intestine and extra-intestinal organs. We highlight aspects of the current knowledge, challenges and limitations in achieving causal understanding of host immune-microbiome interactions, as well as their impact on immune-mediated diseases, and discuss how these insights may translate towards future development of microbiome-targeted therapeutic interventions.",

This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement.

Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

High-salt diets have been linked to high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even autoimmune disorders. But a new study shows that dietary salt could also have immune-boosting effects. Researchers report that high levels of salt in skin help mice fight off bacteria and that humans may also stockpile salt at infection sites. “The idea that salt storage might have evolved for host defense is very exciting,” says Gwen Randolph, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study. “It’s almost so new that it’s hard to swallow. I think it will take some time for the immunology community to allow this concept to take hold.”",

Patients who have immune systems that are suppressed from diseases or medical therapy are at greatly increased risk for cancers linked to viral infections, particularly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin.  Although multiple studies have tried to show a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and SCC, none have been able to show that HPVs actually drive the development of these common skin cancers, say Shawn Demehri, MD, PhD investigator in the Center for Cancer Immunology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) department of Dermatology and the MGH Cancer Center, and colleagues.",

Critically, exposure to commensal microbes or low‐level infection with persisting pathogens can promote tissue homeostasis and enhance resistance to unrelated pathogens.1, 2 However, whether this also extends to protection against the carcinogenic effects of environmental factors such as UV irradiation or toxic agents has remained unclear. In a recent study published in Nature , Strickley and colleagues provide an intriguing example of how constitutive immune activation by a persisting but controlled skin virus, beta papillomavirus, can drive efficient immunity against the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).3 As such, their results provide a fresh view on the clinical association between beta human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and SCC in human patients.",

High-salt diets have been linked to high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even autoimmune disorders. But a new study shows that dietary salt could also have immune-boosting effects. Researchers report that high levels of salt in skin help mice fight off bacteria and that humans may also stockpile salt at infection sites. “The idea that salt storage might have evolved for host defense is very exciting,” says Gwen Randolph, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study. “It’s almost so new that it’s hard to swallow. I think it will take some time for the immunology community to allow this concept to take hold.”",

Those regulations include tracking medications that are returned by stores and healthcare facilities for resale. Currently, the industry uses a patchwork of central databases based on the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standard that features point-to-point connections between manufacturer and distributor; that system is costly and makes large-scale interoperability almost impossible. The central database approach is also open the risk of diversion, counterfeit and a trust gap between siloed systems. Blockchain, a decentralized network that shares information in real time with participants, is being piloted by the pharmaceutical industry as a solution to tracking and tracing the drugs they manufacture and ship.",

Pharmaceutical products see several changes of hands — from the manufacturers to distributors to dispensers and, finally, the patients — allowing easy entry of counterfeit drugs and drug diversions. According to estimates by the WHO, nearly $40 billion is lost each year to counterfeit products. Drug shortages, cost-cutting pressures, demand for generics, and increased online buying further fuel the sale of counterfeit drugs. This not only leads to the loss of billions of dollars, but also increases health risks and recalls, tarnishing the brand image of the already struggling pharmaceutical industry. Track and Trace (T&T) is a new solution that can help pharmaceutical companies effectively manage their supply chain and mitigate the risks associated with counterfeit drugs.

A national requirement to “track and trace” prescription drug packages—in order to prevent counterfeit products from getting into pharmacies—is coming down the pike, thanks to California. That state already has its own deadline in place for January 1, 2015; however, the FDA will almost certainly be replacing the requirement with a national standard to keep the drug-supply chain from getting tangled up in 50 different state laws. The California 2015 deadline for manufacturers to apply an electronic pedigree (e-Pedigree) to each item-level package has been delayed twice before because of anguished cries from manufacturers, wholesalers, and pharmacies that were not ready to comply. The new final deadline is July 1, 2017, for all California pharmacies to authenticate the e-Pedigrees of all packages that arrive at their back door. “The delays in California gave us a little breathing room,” acknowledges Robert J. Bepko, Jr., RPh, MHA, Director of Professional Services at Norwalk Hospital in Connecticut. As a result of those delays, the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP), which develops standards for the pharmacy industry, set up its Work Group 17. This group has been tracking the potential impact of a California e-Pedigree requirement on pharmacies. In December 2010, Work Group 17 issued a white paper on the topic. Mr. Bepko, a member of the Work Group, says that even after California’s deadline for implementation was delayed, Work Group 17 was made aware of efforts by New York and Massachusetts to develop their own e-Pedigree laws. “We are hoping for a national law,” Mr. Bepko asserts.",

A national requirement to “track and trace” prescription drug packages—in order to prevent counterfeit products from getting into pharmacies—is coming down the pike, thanks to California. That state already has its own deadline in place for January 1, 2015; however, the FDA will almost certainly be replacing the requirement with a national standard to keep the drug-supply chain from getting tangled up in 50 different state laws. The California 2015 deadline for manufacturers to apply an electronic pedigree (e-Pedigree) to each item-level package has been delayed twice before because of anguished cries from manufacturers, wholesalers, and pharmacies that were not ready to comply. The new final deadline is July 1, 2017, for all California pharmacies to authenticate the e-Pedigrees of all packages that arrive at their back door. “The delays in California gave us a little breathing room,” acknowledges Robert J. Bepko, Jr., RPh, MHA, Director of Professional Services at Norwalk Hospital in Connecticut. As a result of those delays, the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP), which develops standards for the pharmacy industry, set up its Work Group 17.

The  main  purpose  is  to  identify  and rank  the  most  significant  supply  chain  risks confrontingPharco,  describe  the  risk management strategies as applied by the company, and finally, to make recommendations that  could  improve  the  management  of  supply  chain  risks.  The  research  design  is  mainly qualitative  in  nature,and  draws upon  both  case  study  and  normative  approaches.  Theresearch has identified seven types of risks at Pharco’s supply chain. It has also shown that external risks were perceived to be more significant than internal risks. The research has revealed  that  no  clear  strategy  isdeployed by  the  company  to  mitigatemost  of  its  supply chain risks. Several approaches—based on the concept of cooperation—are suggestedfor improving the management of supply chain risks. The empirical findings ofthis research are expected  to  enhance  the  company’s  understanding  of  its  supply  chain  risks  and  their interconnectedness,which offer valuable insights for tailoring balanced and effective risk-reduction  strategies.  The  findings  of  this  research  serve  as  a  basis  for a further  rigorous research   project,incorporating   the   identification   of   supply   chain   risks   within   the pharmaceutical industry in Egypt.",

The  main  purpose  is  to  identify  and rank  the  most  significant  supply  chain  risks confrontingPharco,  describe  the  risk management strategies as applied by the company, and finally, to make recommendations that  could  improve  the  management  of  supply  chain  risks.  The  research  design  is  mainly qualitative  in  nature,and  draws upon  both  case  study  and  normative  approaches.  Theresearch has identified seven types of risks at Pharco’s supply chain. It has also shown that external risks were perceived to be more significant than internal risks. The research has revealed  that  no  clear  strategy  isdeployed by  the  company  to  mitigatemost  of  its  supply chain risks. Several approaches—based on the concept of cooperation—are suggestedfor improving the management of supply chain risks. The empirical findings ofthis research are expected  to  enhance  the  company’s  understanding  of  its  supply  chain  risks  and  their interconnectedness,which offer valuable insights for tailoring balanced and effective risk-reduction  strategies.  The  findings  of  this  research  serve  as  a  basis  for a further  rigorous research   project,incorporating   the   identification   of   supply   chain   risks   within   the pharmaceutical industry in Egypt.",

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The skin is poised to react to infections and injury, such as sunburn, with rapidly acting mechanisms (innate immunity) that precede the development of acquired immunity and serve as an immediate defense system. Some of these mechanisms, including activation of defensins and complement, modify subsequent acquired immunity. An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin. Thus, inflammatory mechanisms may accentuate the effect of UV radiation to amplify direct damaging effects on molecules and cells, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, which cause immunosuppression, cancer, and photoaging. A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo–skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses.

An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin.

Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin. Thus, inflammatory mechanisms may accentuate the effect of UV radiation to amplify direct damaging effects on molecules and cells, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, which cause immunosuppression, cancer, and photoaging. A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo–skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses.

Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement.

Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation.

This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells.

                            "description": "The interplay between the commensal microbiota and the mammalian immune system development and function includes multifold interactions in homeostasis and disease. The microbiome plays critical roles in the training and development of major components of the host’s innate and adaptive immune system, while the immune system orchestrates the maintenance of key features of host-microbe symbiosis. In a genetically susceptible host, imbalances in microbiota-immunity interactions under defined environmental contexts are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of a multitude of immune-mediated disorders. Here, we review features of microbiome-immunity crosstalk and their roles in health and disease, while providing examples of molecular mechanisms orchestrating these interactions in the intestine and extra-intestinal organs. We highlight aspects of the current knowledge, challenges and limitations in achieving causal understanding of host immune-microbiome interactions, as well as their impact on immune-mediated diseases, and discuss how these insights may translate towards future development of microbiome-targeted therapeutic interventions.",

This finally led to an unexpected diagnosis: Merkel cell carcinoma, or MCC, a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer. After a second surgery, Glusman’s cancer returned and metastases were eventually discovered in his bones. It was advanced. Stage 4. “I thought, ‘I’m dead now’,” Glusman recalled.",

Patients who have immune systems that are suppressed from diseases or medical therapy are at greatly increased risk for cancers linked to viral infections, particularly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin.  Although multiple studies have tried to show a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and SCC, none have been able to show that HPVs actually drive the development of these common skin cancers, say Shawn Demehri, MD, PhD investigator in the Center for Cancer Immunology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) department of Dermatology and the MGH Cancer Center, and colleagues.",

However, breach of the skin barrier through wounding introduces a myriad of microbes to the site of injury. Upon disturbance of the epidermal barrier, the innate immune system and its effectors play a key role in protecting humans against cutaneous and systemic infection [1]. Major constituents of the innate immune system include phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, as well as innate leukocytes, such as natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. In addition, epidermal keratinocytes act as active innate immune cells. In response to sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by microbes and host danger molecules, innate immune receptors present on keratinocytes become activated, causing release of inflammatory cytokines and host antimicrobial molecules",

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin.

A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo–skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

Some of these mechanisms, including activation of defensins and complement, modify subsequent acquired immunity. An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin.

A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo–skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance.

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

Some of these mechanisms, including activation of defensins and complement, modify subsequent acquired immunity. An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin.

A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo–skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

Some of these mechanisms, including activation of defensins and complement, modify subsequent acquired immunity. An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin.

A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo–skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance.

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

However, breach of the skin barrier through wounding introduces a myriad of microbes to the site of injury. Upon disturbance of the epidermal barrier, the innate immune system and its effectors play a key role in protecting humans against cutaneous and systemic infection [1]. Major constituents of the innate immune system include phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, as well as innate leukocytes, such as natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. In addition, epidermal keratinocytes act as active innate immune cells. In response to sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by microbes and host danger molecules, innate immune receptors present on keratinocytes become activated, causing release of inflammatory cytokines and host antimicrobial molecules",

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells.

This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells.

Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement.

Patients who have immune systems that are suppressed from diseases or medical therapy are at greatly increased risk for cancers linked to viral infections, particularly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin.  Although multiple studies have tried to show a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and SCC, none have been able to show that HPVs actually drive the development of these common skin cancers, say Shawn Demehri, MD, PhD investigator in the Center for Cancer Immunology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) department of Dermatology and the MGH Cancer Center, and colleagues.",

In a recent study published in Nature , Strickley and colleagues provide an intriguing example of how constitutive immune activation by a persisting but controlled skin virus, beta papillomavirus, can drive efficient immunity against the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).3 As such, their results provide a fresh view on the clinical association between beta human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and SCC in human patients.",

High-salt diets have been linked to high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even autoimmune disorders. But a new study shows that dietary salt could also have immune-boosting effects. Researchers report that high levels of salt in skin help mice fight off bacteria and that humans may also stockpile salt at infection sites. “The idea that salt storage might have evolved for host defense is very exciting,” says Gwen Randolph, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study. “It’s almost so new that it’s hard to swallow. I think it will take some time for the immunology community to allow this concept to take hold.”",

Patients who have immune systems that are suppressed from diseases or medical therapy are at greatly increased risk for cancers linked to viral infections, particularly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin.  Although multiple studies have tried to show a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and SCC, none have been able to show that HPVs actually drive the development of these common skin cancers, say Shawn Demehri, MD, PhD investigator in the Center for Cancer Immunology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) department of Dermatology and the MGH Cancer Center, and colleagues.",

However, breach of the skin barrier through wounding introduces a myriad of microbes to the site of injury. Upon disturbance of the epidermal barrier, the innate immune system and its effectors play a key role in protecting humans against cutaneous and systemic infection [1]. Major constituents of the innate immune system include phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, as well as innate leukocytes, such as natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. In addition, epidermal keratinocytes act as active innate immune cells. In response to sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by microbes and host danger molecules, innate immune receptors present on keratinocytes become activated, causing release of inflammatory cytokines and host antimicrobial molecules",

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

However, breach of the skin barrier through wounding introduces a myriad of microbes to the site of injury. Upon disturbance of the epidermal barrier, the innate immune system and its effectors play a key role in protecting humans against cutaneous and systemic infection [1]. Major constituents of the innate immune system include phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, as well as innate leukocytes, such as natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. In addition, epidermal keratinocytes act as active innate immune cells. In response to sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by microbes and host danger molecules, innate immune receptors present on keratinocytes become activated, causing release of inflammatory cytokines and host antimicrobial molecules",

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

It is made up of diverse indole alkaloids and is used as traditional medicine for skin application. The actual mechanism behind the virtue of this plant is still unknown. Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Over the years, the skin was proven to have a crucial immunological role, not only being a passive protective barrier but a network of effector cells and molecular mediators that constitute a highly sophisticated compound known as the “skin immune system” (SIS). Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement. However, under stress, the symbiotic relationship changes into a dysbiotic one resulting in skin disorders. Hence, the skin microbiota may have either positive or negative influence on the immune system. This review aims at providing basic background information on the cutaneous immune system from major cellular and molecular players and the impact of its microbiota on the well-coordinated immune responses in host defense.",

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement.

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Patients who have immune systems that are suppressed from diseases or medical therapy are at greatly increased risk for cancers linked to viral infections, particularly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin.  Although multiple studies have tried to show a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and SCC, none have been able to show that HPVs actually drive the development of these common skin cancers, say Shawn Demehri, MD, PhD investigator in the Center for Cancer Immunology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) department of Dermatology and the MGH Cancer Center, and colleagues.",

Critically, exposure to commensal microbes or low‐level infection with persisting pathogens can promote tissue homeostasis and enhance resistance to unrelated pathogens.1, 2 However, whether this also extends to protection against the carcinogenic effects of environmental factors such as UV irradiation or toxic agents has remained unclear. In a recent study published in Nature , Strickley and colleagues provide an intriguing example of how constitutive immune activation by a persisting but controlled skin virus, beta papillomavirus, can drive efficient immunity against the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).3 As such, their results provide a fresh view on the clinical association between beta human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and SCC in human patients.",

High-salt diets have been linked to high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even autoimmune disorders. But a new study shows that dietary salt could also have immune-boosting effects. Researchers report that high levels of salt in skin help mice fight off bacteria and that humans may also stockpile salt at infection sites. “The idea that salt storage might have evolved for host defense is very exciting,” says Gwen Randolph, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study. “It’s almost so new that it’s hard to swallow. I think it will take some time for the immunology community to allow this concept to take hold.”",

Patients who have immune systems that are suppressed from diseases or medical therapy are at greatly increased risk for cancers linked to viral infections, particularly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin.  Although multiple studies have tried to show a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and SCC, none have been able to show that HPVs actually drive the development of these common skin cancers, say Shawn Demehri, MD, PhD investigator in the Center for Cancer Immunology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) department of Dermatology and the MGH Cancer Center, and colleagues.",

In a recent study published in Nature , Strickley and colleagues provide an intriguing example of how constitutive immune activation by a persisting but controlled skin virus, beta papillomavirus, can drive efficient immunity against the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).3 As such, their results provide a fresh view on the clinical association between beta human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and SCC in human patients.",

Researchers report that high levels of salt in skin help mice fight off bacteria and that humans may also stockpile salt at infection sites. “The idea that salt storage might have evolved for host defense is very exciting,” says Gwen Randolph, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study. “It’s almost so new that it’s hard to swallow. I think it will take some time for the immunology community to allow this concept to take hold.”",

However, breach of the skin barrier through wounding introduces a myriad of microbes to the site of injury. Upon disturbance of the epidermal barrier, the innate immune system and its effectors play a key role in protecting humans against cutaneous and systemic infection [1]. Major constituents of the innate immune system include phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, as well as innate leukocytes, such as natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. In addition, epidermal keratinocytes act as active innate immune cells. In response to sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by microbes and host danger molecules, innate immune receptors present on keratinocytes become activated, causing release of inflammatory cytokines and host antimicrobial molecules",

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response. In this review, we describe current evidence for the basis of the interactions between pathogens, microbiota, and immune cells on surface barriers and offer explanations for how these interactions may lead to chronic inflammatory disorders.",

The skin is poised to react to infections and injury, such as sunburn, with rapidly acting mechanisms (innate immunity) that precede the development of acquired immunity and serve as an immediate defense system. Some of these mechanisms, including activation of defensins and complement, modify subsequent acquired immunity. An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.

These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses.

Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response. In this review, we describe current evidence for the basis of the interactions between pathogens, microbiota, and immune cells on surface barriers and offer explanations for how these interactions may lead to chronic inflammatory disorders.",

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin.

Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.

Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response. In this review, we describe current evidence for the basis of the interactions between pathogens, microbiota, and immune cells on surface barriers and offer explanations for how these interactions may lead to chronic inflammatory disorders.",

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

However, breach of the skin barrier through wounding introduces a myriad of microbes to the site of injury. Upon disturbance of the epidermal barrier, the innate immune system and its effectors play a key role in protecting humans against cutaneous and systemic infection [1]. Major constituents of the innate immune system include phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, as well as innate leukocytes, such as natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. In addition, epidermal keratinocytes act as active innate immune cells. In response to sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by microbes and host danger molecules, innate immune receptors present on keratinocytes become activated, causing release of inflammatory cytokines and host antimicrobial molecules",

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The incredible variation in skin — oily, moist, or dry, exposed to light and cold, or dark and warm — even on an individual, creates unique habitats for the thousands of bacterial and fungal species (called commensal microbiota) that live on our skin. The skin immune system may control skin microbes, but our skin commensals can also educate our immune system.

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response. In this review, we describe current evidence for the basis of the interactions between pathogens, microbiota, and immune cells on surface barriers and offer explanations for how these interactions may lead to chronic inflammatory disorders.",

The skin is poised to react to infections and injury, such as sunburn, with rapidly acting mechanisms (innate immunity) that precede the development of acquired immunity and serve as an immediate defense system. Some of these mechanisms, including activation of defensins and complement, modify subsequent acquired immunity. An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin. Thus, inflammatory mechanisms may accentuate the effect of UV radiation to amplify direct damaging effects on molecules and cells, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, which cause immunosuppression, cancer, and photoaging. A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo–skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance. Greater knowledge of these processes will also enable the development of improved strategies to repair photodamaged skin.",

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

It is made up of diverse indole alkaloids and is used as traditional medicine for skin application. The actual mechanism behind the virtue of this plant is still unknown. Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement. However, under stress, the symbiotic relationship changes into a dysbiotic one resulting in skin disorders. Hence, the skin microbiota may have either positive or negative influence on the immune system. This review aims at providing basic background information on the cutaneous immune system from major cellular and molecular players and the impact of its microbiota on the well-coordinated immune responses in host defense.",

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement.

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

It is made up of diverse indole alkaloids and is used as traditional medicine for skin application. The actual mechanism behind the virtue of this plant is still unknown. Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

                            "description": "BOSTON – Viruses get a bad rap as potential cancer-causers, but at least one class of viruses that commonly live on human skin – so-called “low-risk” human papillomaviruses -- appear to play an unwitting role in protecting us against skin cancer according to a new study published in Nature. Patients who have immune systems that are suppressed from diseases or medical therapy are at greatly increased risk for cancers linked to viral infections, particularly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin.  Although multiple studies have tried to show a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and SCC, none have been able to show that HPVs actually drive the development of these common skin cancers, say Shawn Demehri, MD, PhD investigator in the Center for Cancer Immunology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) department of Dermatology and the MGH Cancer Center, and colleagues.",

Critically, exposure to commensal microbes or low‐level infection with persisting pathogens can promote tissue homeostasis and enhance resistance to unrelated pathogens.1, 2 However, whether this also extends to protection against the carcinogenic effects of environmental factors such as UV irradiation or toxic agents has remained unclear. In a recent study published in Nature , Strickley and colleagues provide an intriguing example of how constitutive immune activation by a persisting but controlled skin virus, beta papillomavirus, can drive efficient immunity against the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).3 As such, their results provide a fresh view on the clinical association between beta human papilloma virus (HPV) infection and SCC in human patients.",

High-salt diets have been linked to high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even autoimmune disorders. But a new study shows that dietary salt could also have immune-boosting effects. Researchers report that high levels of salt in skin help mice fight off bacteria and that humans may also stockpile salt at infection sites. “The idea that salt storage might have evolved for host defense is very exciting,” says Gwen Randolph, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study. “It’s almost so new that it’s hard to swallow. I think it will take some time for the immunology community to allow this concept to take hold.”",

In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.

The incredible variation in skin — oily, moist, or dry, exposed to light and cold, or dark and warm — even on an individual, creates unique habitats for the thousands of bacterial and fungal species (called commensal microbiota) that live on our skin.

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response. In this review, we describe current evidence for the basis of the interactions between pathogens, microbiota, and immune cells on surface barriers and offer explanations for how these interactions may lead to chronic inflammatory disorders.",

The skin is poised to react to infections and injury, such as sunburn, with rapidly acting mechanisms (innate immunity) that precede the development of acquired immunity and serve as an immediate defense system. Some of these mechanisms, including activation of defensins and complement, modify subsequent acquired immunity. An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin. Thus, inflammatory mechanisms may accentuate the effect of UV radiation to amplify direct damaging effects on molecules and cells, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, which cause immunosuppression, cancer, and photoaging. A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo–skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance. Greater knowledge of these processes will also enable the development of improved strategies to repair photodamaged skin.",

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

At 1.8 square meters for the average adult, skin covers about as much area as a large closet, and accounts for 12-15% of total body weight. The incredible variation in skin — oily, moist, or dry, exposed to light and cold, or dark and warm — even on an individual, creates unique habitats for the thousands of bacterial and fungal species (called commensal microbiota) that live on our skin. The skin immune system may control skin microbes, but our skin commensals can also educate our immune system. How our skin orchestrates this dialogue with microorganisms and physical insult is integral to its function, and to our health.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response. In this review, we describe current evidence for the basis of the interactions between pathogens, microbiota, and immune cells on surface barriers and offer explanations for how these interactions may lead to chronic inflammatory disorders.",

The skin is poised to react to infections and injury, such as sunburn, with rapidly acting mechanisms (innate immunity) that precede the development of acquired immunity and serve as an immediate defense system. Some of these mechanisms, including activation of defensins and complement, modify subsequent acquired immunity. An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin. Thus, inflammatory mechanisms may accentuate the effect of UV radiation to amplify direct damaging effects on molecules and cells, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, which cause immunosuppression, cancer, and photoaging. A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo–skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance. Greater knowledge of these processes will also enable the development of improved strategies to repair photodamaged skin.",

This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells.

Over the years, the skin was proven to have a crucial immunological role, not only being a passive protective barrier but a network of effector cells and molecular mediators that constitute a highly sophisticated compound known as the “skin immune system” (SIS). Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement. However, under stress, the symbiotic relationship changes into a dysbiotic one resulting in skin disorders. Hence, the skin microbiota may have either positive or negative influence on the immune system.

In a genetically susceptible host, imbalances in microbiota-immunity interactions under defined environmental contexts are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of a multitude of immune-mediated disorders. Here, we review features of microbiome-immunity crosstalk and their roles in health and disease, while providing examples of molecular mechanisms orchestrating these interactions in the intestine and extra-intestinal organs.

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Of paramount importance are immunological functions of the skin that protect from harmful exposure coming from external and internal environments. Awareness of skin immunity can provide a better comprehension of inflammation, autoimmunity, cancer, graft-versus-host disease, vaccination, and immunotherapy approaches. This paper will update on what we currently know about immune sentinels contributing to skin immunity.",

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells. Finally the reciprocal interactions between the skin microbiota and immune system and their role in host defence and disease have been discussed. ",

It is made up of diverse indole alkaloids and is used as traditional medicine for skin application. The actual mechanism behind the virtue of this plant is still unknown. Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Over the years, the skin was proven to have a crucial immunological role, not only being a passive protective barrier but a network of effector cells and molecular mediators that constitute a highly sophisticated compound known as the “skin immune system” (SIS). Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement. However, under stress, the symbiotic relationship changes into a dysbiotic one resulting in skin disorders. Hence, the skin microbiota may have either positive or negative influence on the immune system. This review aims at providing basic background information on the cutaneous immune system from major cellular and molecular players and the impact of its microbiota on the well-coordinated immune responses in host defense.",

The microbiome plays critical roles in the training and development of major components of the host’s innate and adaptive immune system, while the immune system orchestrates the maintenance of key features of host-microbe symbiosis. In a genetically susceptible host, imbalances in microbiota-immunity interactions under defined environmental contexts are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of a multitude of immune-mediated disorders. Here, we review features of microbiome-immunity crosstalk and their roles in health and disease, while providing examples of molecular mechanisms orchestrating these interactions in the intestine and extra-intestinal organs. We highlight aspects of the current knowledge, challenges and limitations in achieving causal understanding of host immune-microbiome interactions, as well as their impact on immune-mediated diseases, and discuss how these insights may translate towards future development of microbiome-targeted therapeutic interventions.",

High-salt diets have been linked to high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even autoimmune disorders. But a new study shows that dietary salt could also have immune-boosting effects. Researchers report that high levels of salt in skin help mice fight off bacteria and that humans may also stockpile salt at infection sites. “The idea that salt storage might have evolved for host defense is very exciting,” says Gwen Randolph, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not involved in the study. “It’s almost so new that it’s hard to swallow. I think it will take some time for the immunology community to allow this concept to take hold.”",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response. In this review, we describe current evidence for the basis of the interactions between pathogens, microbiota, and immune cells on surface barriers and offer explanations for how these interactions may lead to chronic inflammatory disorders.",

The skin is poised to react to infections and injury, such as sunburn, with rapidly acting mechanisms (innate immunity) that precede the development of acquired immunity and serve as an immediate defense system. Some of these mechanisms, including activation of defensins and complement, modify subsequent acquired immunity. An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin. Thus, inflammatory mechanisms may accentuate the effect of UV radiation to amplify direct damaging effects on molecules and cells, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, which cause immunosuppression, cancer, and photoaging. A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo–skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance. Greater knowledge of these processes will also enable the development of improved strategies to repair photodamaged skin.",

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin.

A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo–skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response. In this review, we describe current evidence for the basis of the interactions between pathogens, microbiota, and immune cells on surface barriers and offer explanations for how these interactions may lead to chronic inflammatory disorders.",

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.

Using 16S ribosomal RNA metagenomic sequencing, scientists recognized that the microorganism colonization has greater diversity and variability than previously assumed. These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

The skin also has important homeostatic functions such as reducing water loss and contributing to thermoregulation of the body. The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Together, these alterations result in decreased barrier immunity in the elderly, explaining in part their increased susceptiblity to cancer and infections.",

These microorganisms, such as commensal bacteria, affect the host’s immune response against pathogens and modulate chronic inflammatory responses. Previously, a single pathogen was thought to cause a single disease, but current evidence suggests that dysbiosis of the tissue microbiota may underlie the disease status. Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response.

An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin.

Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance.

The structure of the skin and its cellular composition work in harmony to prevent infections and to deal with physical and chemical challenges from the outside world. In this review, we discuss how the structural cells such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts and adipocytes contribute to barrier immunity. We also discuss specialized immune cells that are resident in steady‐state skin including mononuclear phagocytes, such as Langerhans cells, dermal macrophages and dermal dendritic cells in addition to the resident memory T cells. Ageing results in an increased incidence of cancer and skin infections. As we age, the skin structure changes with thinning of the epidermis and dermis, increased water loss, and fragmentation of collagen and elastin. In addition, the skin immune composition is altered with reduced Langerhans cells, decreased antigen‐specific immunity and increased regulatory populations such as Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.

Dysbiosis results in aberrant immune responses at the surface and furthermore, affects the systemic immune response. Hence, understanding the initial interaction between the barrier surface immune system and local microorganisms is important for understanding the overall systemic effects of the immune response. In this review, we describe current evidence for the basis of the interactions between pathogens, microbiota, and immune cells on surface barriers and offer explanations for how these interactions may lead to chronic inflammatory disorders.",

                            "description": "The immune system may either have a protective role against sunburn and skin cancer or, conversely, promote solar damage. The skin is poised to react to infections and injury, such as sunburn, with rapidly acting mechanisms (innate immunity) that precede the development of acquired immunity and serve as an immediate defense system. Some of these mechanisms, including activation of defensins and complement, modify subsequent acquired immunity. An array of induced immune-regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediators is evident, at the gene expression level, from the microarray analysis of both intrinsically aged and photoaged skin. Thus, inflammatory mechanisms may accentuate the effect of UV radiation to amplify direct damaging effects on molecules and cells, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, which cause immunosuppression, cancer, and photoaging. A greater understanding of the cutaneous immune system's response to photo–skin interactions is essential to comprehensively protect the skin from adverse solar effects. Sunscreen product protection measured only as reduction in redness (current “sun” protection factor) may no longer be sufficient, as it is becoming clear that protection against UV-induced immune changes is of equal if not of greater importance. Greater knowledge of these processes will also enable the development of improved strategies to repair photodamaged skin.",

The nature of antigens present and interplay between the cutaneous innate and adaptive immune systems determine the type of immune response generated. Dendritic cells are the key players in bridging innate and adaptive immune responses due to their inherent plasticity, direct roles in both type of immune responses, and cross-talk with other immune cells. This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells.

This review dissects the functional roles of components of both innate and adaptive immune systems in the skin, with a special focus on cutaneous dendritic cells as the only cells capable of inducing primary immune responses, their ability to generate either immunogenic or tolerogenic immune responses, and ability to direct effector cells back to the skin via imprinting of skin-homing properties on T-cells.

Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement.

It is made up of diverse indole alkaloids and is used as traditional medicine for skin application. The actual mechanism behind the virtue of this plant is still unknown. Hence, in this study we aimed at deciphering the impact of R. nukuhivensis on skin immune system in context of (1) homeostasis, (2) pathogen infection and (3) inflammation. Here we show that R. nukuhivensis enhances cellular metabolic activity and wound healing without inducing cellular stress or disturbing cellular homeostasis. It reinforces the epithelial barrier by up-regulating hBD-1. Nevertheless, in pathogenic stress, R. nukuhivensis acts by preparing the immune system to be reactive and effective directly. Indeed, it enhances the innate immune response by increasing pathogens sensors such as TLR5. Finally, R. nukuhivensis blocks IL-22 induced hyperproliferation via PTEN and Filaggrin up-regulation as well as BCL-2 downregulation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence on the several cutaneous application potentials of R. nukuhivensis such as boosting the immune response or in restoring the integrity of the epithelial barrier.",

Over the years, the skin was proven to have a crucial immunological role, not only being a passive protective barrier but a network of effector cells and molecular mediators that constitute a highly sophisticated compound known as the “skin immune system” (SIS). Studies of skin immune sentinels provided essential insights of a complex and dynamic immunity, which was achieved through interaction between the external and internal cutaneous compartments. In fact, the skin surface is cohabited by microorganisms recognized as skin microbiota that live in complete harmony with the immune sentinels and contribute to the epithelial barrier reinforcement. However, under stress, the symbiotic relationship changes into a dysbiotic one resulting in skin disorders. Hence, the skin microbiota may have either positive or negative influence on the immune system. This review aims at providing basic background information on the cutaneous immune system from major cellular and molecular players and the impact of its microbiota on the well-coordinated immune responses in host defense.",

The microbiome plays critical roles in the training and development of major components of the host’s innate and adaptive immune system, while the immune system orchestrates the maintenance of key features of host-microbe symbiosis. In a genetically susceptible host, imbalances in microbiota-immunity interactions under defined environmental contexts are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of a multitude of immune-mediated disorders. Here, we review features of microbiome-immunity crosstalk and their roles in health and disease, while providing examples of molecular mechanisms orchestrating these interactions in the intestine and extra-intestinal organs. We highlight aspects of the current knowledge, challenges and limitations in achieving causal understanding of host immune-microbiome interactions, as well as their impact on immune-mediated diseases, and discuss how these insights may translate towards future development of microbiome-targeted therapeutic interventions.",
